    <h1>Interneting Takes Practice!</h1>
    <p>Let's do some basic HTML! This is a paragraph.</p>

    <h2>This is a h2 heading.</h2>
    <p>There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>The following list is an <b>unordered list</b>, which — as far as I can
      tell — just means it's not numbered.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start the list with a "ul" (unordered list) element.</li>
      <li>Each item is put in its own "li" (list item) element.</li>
      <li><p>And, since this is an unordered list, the items don't need to be in
        any particular order. This item also enclosed in "p" for fun.</p>
        <p>This is a new paragraph within that same list item. It clearly does
        some funky stuff with the formatting. Meh. I probably won't do this
        because it doesn't look very good with the other list items.</p></li>
      <li>This should actually be a ordered list because these items don't make
        sense when they're out of order. Oops. This is just for demonstration
        purposes, though, so it doesn't really matter.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following list is an <b>ordered list</b>, which is a list that has an
      order. There's no better explanation.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>This is basically just a numbered list.</li>
      <li>Ooh, new item!</li>
      <li>And this is the third item! Wow!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <p><em>Yes!</em> Now we're getting into some <em>fun</em> stuff. These
      italics can also be made <i>like this</i> and they're cool. I know it
      says not to just the i one though, so I guess it's just em from here on
      out? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
    <p>Be <b>bold,</b> be <strong>brave</strong>. I used both b and strong just
      then, but normally I just use the b because it doesn't take as long to
      type as strong. I guess I'll stick to strong from now on though?</p>
    <p>Anyway, here's something <em><strong>so important</strong></em> that it
      requires both italics <i><b>and</b></i> bold! Like
      <em><strong>shouting!</em></strong></p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
    <p>Now, line breaks. <br/>
      Whoa, new line! But not a new paragraph! Line breaks are nice.</p>
    <p>Oh, but this one is my favorite:</p>
    <hr />
    <p>A hr! I didn't know it stood for horizontal rule but you learn something
      new every day. Very useful for scene breaks and such in writing.</p>
